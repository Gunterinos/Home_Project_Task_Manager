# Home Project Task Manager
The idea behind this application is to have a simple and clean task organizer/project management. Many applications offer this service, but many are too cluttered and complex. Therefore, I am offering a simple more robust application for tracking tasks.

Brainstorming and starting to create design requirements: https://www.figma.com/file/lIjdku03zuobjtLcfRU9HX/Untitled?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=V9iwaRniZjIalRfe-1

The plan for the project is to brainstorm ideas and create design requirements from these ideas. Then create an architecture for the project following design patterns that allow for scalability and future expansion. Lastly, develop the app with the target of fulfilling the must-haves requirements. Suppose they are done faster than the planned time frame moving on to doing the other requirements. I am planning to make weekly updates to the project.

**Design Requierments**

**Must-Haves:**
- [ ] Implement a menu screen facilitating access to all sections.
- [ ] Divide the menu screen into two sections: "Favorites" and other sections placed below the favourites.
- [ ] Ensure the menu screen is scrollable for easy scalability.
- [ ] Enable the addition and removal of favourites within the menu screen.
- [ ] Allow deletion of each section directly from the menu screen.
- [ ] Ensure that the main screen for a section adopts the colour scheme defined in the menu screen.
- [ ] Allow customization of each subsection on the main screen, including the ability to change the order, name, and colour.
- [ ] Provide a button for creating new subsections.
- [ ] Each subsection must include a list of tasks, a calendar, and a description, with the background colour matching the section screen.
- [ ] Include the parent section's name in each subsection's title.

**Should-Haves:**
- [ ] Display a preview of subsections within each section, prioritising the most important ones.
- [ ] Enable the dragging of sections to the "Favorites" section to designate them as favourites.
- [ ] Allow users to rearrange subsections by dragging to change their ranking.
- [ ] Implement right-click functionality to create new sections in the menu screen.
- [ ] Enable right-click functionality to create new subsections on the main screen for each section.

**Could-Haves:**
- [ ] Implement user accounts to save data across sessions.
- [ ] Enable the sharing of sections with other users for collaborative task management.
- [ ] Introduce a "Recently Deleted" section to easily recover deleted content.
- [ ] Allow users to change the overall theme of the application.
- [ ] Implement alarms for specific tasks.
- [ ] Enable subsections to have nested subsections indefinitely.

**Won't-Haves:**
- Exclude web access.
- Do not support access on other platforms such as Linux and Mac.
