# Home Project Task Manager
The idea behind this application is to have a simple and clean task organizer/project management. Many applications offer this service, but many are too cluttered and complex. Therefore, I am offering a simple more robust application for tracking tasks.

Brainstorming and starting to create design requirements: https://www.figma.com/file/lIjdku03zuobjtLcfRU9HX/Untitled?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=V9iwaRniZjIalRfe-1

The plan for the project is to brainstorm ideas and create design requirements from these ideas. Then create an architecture for the project following design patterns that allow for scalability and future expansion. Lastly, develop the app with the target of fulfilling the must-haves requirements. Suppose they are done faster than the planned time frame moving on to doing the other requirements. I am planning to make weekly updates to the project.
